# Infinite-STT
Steps :-
1. You first need to install and enable Google Voice Typing.
2. Download Offline languages.
3. Give explicit permission to the app to use the Microphone.


The marquee Text will display the sentence which is being spoken currently (Like in Google Assistant).
This app converts Speech to text without any pause and while being offline.
I've implemented the SpeechRecognizer and used it in a service so that It keeps on listening even if the app is in the background.
